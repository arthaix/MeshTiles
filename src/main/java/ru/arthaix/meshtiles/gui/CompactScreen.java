 * A screen drawn one GUI scale step finer than the rest of the game, and finer still until it fits the window.
 *
 * The screens of this mod are big; at the scale Minecraft picks on its own they ran off the bottom of the monitor.
 * The screen is simply given the width and height it would have at the smaller scale and drawn through a matching
 * shrink, so every position inside it stays as written. Clicks already come in at the right place, because Minecraft
 * works them out from the screen's own width and height; only the pointer handed to drawScreen needs the same care.
